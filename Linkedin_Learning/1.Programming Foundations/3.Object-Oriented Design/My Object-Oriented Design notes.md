Programming Foundations: Object-Oriented Design
________________________________________________

Intro: 
Unified Modeling Language(UML): Standardized notation for diagrams to visualize object-oriented systems.

1.Object-Oriented Fundamentals:
Objects: All objects have... 
-Identity
-Attributes
-Behaviors

Put "The" before the noun to know if it's an object.

Class: Code-template for creating program objects.

Class components:
-Name or type 
-Attributes, properties or data
-Behavior or operations

when we write behavior as code, they're typically called a method.

Method: A program procedure that can return a value.
Defined as part of a class. (the difference between functions)

After defining the class, I can create objects based on it through a process called instantiation. (and it's called that becuase each object I create is an instance of that particular class.

Abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance

Polymorphism has many forms:

Dynamic Polymorphism: Uses the same interface for methods on different types of objects.

Static (Compile-Time) Polymorphism: It uses Method Overloading: Implements multiple methods with the same name, but different parameters.

FURPS Requirements: Functionality, Usability, Reliablility, Performance, Supportablility.

Domain Modeling: 

CRC cards: Class, Responsibility, Collaboration

Class Diagrams: 

Constructor: A special method that gets called to create an object.
Destructor: A special method that gets called when the object is destroyed.
Finalizer = Destructor (language that uses garbage collector)

Inheritance and Composition:

Interface: List of methods for a class to implement. It doesn't contain any actual behavior.
