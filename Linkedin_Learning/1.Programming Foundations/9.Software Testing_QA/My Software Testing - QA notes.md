# Programming Foundations: Software Testing/QA

___________________________________________________

## Introduction:

Quality Assurance: A systematic process used to determine whether a product meets specifications

Specialists in Software Testing
- QA 
- QA engineer
- QA analyst
- Software engineer in test 
- Tester 

## 1.The Role of QA

### 1.2.Get involved throughout the SDLC:
 
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

- Plan
- Define
- Design
- Build
- Test 
- Deploy

## 2.Test Planning

### 2.3.Write acceptance criteria:

Acceptance Criteria: Conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by a stakeholder

## 3.Types of Testing QA Focuses On

### 3.1.Box testing:

Types of Black Box Tests:

- Manual testing
- UI automation testing

Gray Box Tests:

- Integration testing 
- Trigger some action in the UI

Type of White Box Tests:

- Unit
- System

### 3.3.UI automation testing:

Benefit of UI automation: Scenarios can be executed repeatedly and catch regressions introduced in the application.

### 3.4.Integration testing:

Integration tests are gray box tests.

### 3.5.Performance testing:

Performance testing benchmarks how a system performs under load.

Performance testing is a type of black box testing.

Performance testing is done to make sure an application runs fast and well.

Manual, UI automation, and integration tests are more common, but performance testing is also very valuable.

#### Other types of tests:

Load testing checks the application's ability to perform under user loads.

Endurance testing checks how an application handles load over time.
Goal of endurance testing is to check for system problems.

Stress testing involves testing an application under extreme workloads. It is used for testing scalability.

### Common Performance Problems:

- Long load time 
- Poor scalability
- Bottlenecking

### 3.6.Security testing:

Security testing exposes problems in the application that can cause unexpected behaviour or crashes.

SQL Injection: SQL injection is used to insert database statements into text fields and expose applicaton information.

Denial of Service (DoS): Denial of services (DoS) is an attack where hackers try to take down an application's servers or network.

## 4.Bug Reporting

### 4.3.Triage bugs:

Severity: How impactful the bug is to the business

Priority: How fast the bug should be fixed
